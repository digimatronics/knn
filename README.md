k Nearest Neighbor - Property Categorization
----------------------

This is a rewrite of the challenge presented by Burak Kanber, from his Machine Learning series.

## Getting Started

Add anything you want to the `src` directory, and all tests will follow a matching name under the `test/src` directory. So if you were to create a `some.h` in `src`, then a test file could be placed in `test/src/some_test.cpp`.

To make this project template specific to your project, please rename the `PROJECT` name in `CMakeLists.txt` under the `test` directory to match your project name.

## Compiling

To compile and run the test suite, make sure you have the latest gmock (currently version 1.7.0) in the same directory as the project folder (one directory above this README file).

Now that gmock is built, `cd` into the `test` directory and run `cmake .`.
