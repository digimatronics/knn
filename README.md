## The Problem

Given the number of rooms and area (in square feet) of a type of dwelling, figure out if itâ€™s an apartment, house, or flat.

## Compiling

To compile and run the test suite, make sure you have the latest gmock (currently version 1.7.0) in the same directory as the project folder (one directory above this README file).

Now that gmock is built, `cd` into the `test` directory and run `cmake .`.
